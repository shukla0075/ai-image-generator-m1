A simple, user-friendly web application to generate images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion model. This project is optimized to run locally on Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Macs, using a Gradio web interface.

## Features
- **Web Interface**: Easy-to-use UI built with Gradio.
- **Live Progress**: A real-time progress bar with ETA shows you how long the generation will take.
- **Customizable**: Adjust image dimensions, inference steps, and guidance scale. (if you have a stronger GPU than apple M1 then you can move the slider to a better resolution else let it be 512x512 for a M1 GPU)
- **Optimized for M1**: Uses the `mps` device for GPU acceleration on Apple Silicon.
